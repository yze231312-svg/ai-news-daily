    "role": "You are a professional Frontend Developer (Gemini 3 Pro). Your task is to refactor the AI Daily News frontend into a modern, responsive, and high-quality Twitter-style AI news aggregator.",

    "requirements": {
      "ui_style": "Modern, sleek, dark-mode preferred. Use a 'feed' layout similar to Twitter or Linear. Focus on premium aesthetics.",
      "responsive": "Must work perfectly on mobile and desktop.",
      "features": [
        "Category tabs (Open Source, Tutorial, Model, Free, Tool) based on `categories` in `data.json`.",
        "News cards that show author info (avatar, name, handle), timestamp, content, and metrics (likes, retweets).",
        "Clicking a card should open the original tweet URL in a new tab.",
        "Last updated timestamp display.",
        "Smooth scroll and hover animations."
      ],
      "stack": "Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS or any lightweight framework you prefer (e.g., Vite/Preact if requested, but Vanilla is safe). Use modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, Variables)."
